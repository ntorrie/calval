The calval package contains a collection of functions to assist with the
flagging and visualization of validation data collected during quality
assurance testing of CMAR Coastal Monitoring Program sensors. Sensor
testing occurs prior to sensor deployment to ensure sensors are
recording within spec. Testing occurs again after sensors are retrieved
from deployment to check for sensor drift and biofouling impacts.

## Installation

You can install the development version of calval from
[GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
