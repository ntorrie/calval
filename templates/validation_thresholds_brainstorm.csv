Questions:,,,,,,,,
"For post-deployment validation, could Anne just not bother to offload deployment data, and immediately start the post-val with the sensors still running (code trims dataset)",,,,,,,,
Should we update the code so each sensor type is only compared to others of the same type? Would need 4 of each sensor type in each validation batch,,,,,,,,
For the VR2 test select one observation/hr for every sensor type for the median calculation. For all other sensors run the temp test as normal. VR2 results will be separate.,,,,,,,,
