The calval package contains a collection of functions to assist with the flagging and visualization of validation data collected during quality assurance testing of CMAR Coastal Monitoring Program sensors. Sensor testing occurs prior to sensor deployment to ensure sensors are recording within spec. Testing occurs again after sensors are 
retrieved from deployment to check for sensor drift and biofouling impacts. 

## Installation

You can install the development version of calval from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("ntorrie/calval")
```
